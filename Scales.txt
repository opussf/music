	(Caug)	C - E - G#

Major 7 	Play 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 scale degrees
  (C maj7)	C - E - G - B

Dominant 7	Play 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 scale degrees, lower 7th 1/2 step

Minor 7 	Play 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 scale degrees, lower 3rd and 7th 1/2 step
	(Cm7)	C - Eb - G - Bb

Diminished 7 Play 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 scale degrees, lower 3rd & 5th 1/2 step, lower 7th whole step
	(C dim)	C - Eb - Gb - A
